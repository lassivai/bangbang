# Bang Bang

Version 0.??? <br />

A 2D action game inspired by 90s Finnish indie games such as Liero, Molez and Wings. The target has been old school style pixel based graphics and physics, with effects empowered by 20+ years progress in computer performance.<br />

The current version features two characters dueling against each other. The amount of characters may change in later versions. Each character can be controlled either by human player or AI. The static map will possible be also transformed to a larger and movable map in later versions.<br />
